Dashboard module
================

This module is responsible for setting up the core variables and defining the overall structure of the dashboard layout.

Following the layout definition, the module implements several **callback functions**, which form the interactive logic of the dashboard. These callbacks dynamically respond to user inputs - such as filter selections or navigation clicks - and update the displayed content accordingly, enabling a responsive and user-driven interface.
