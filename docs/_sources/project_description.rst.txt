AI-supported market analysis of compensation & benefits in M&A integrations
===========================================================================

Introduction and Motivation
----------------------------

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) create significant challenges for companies, particularly in aligning compensation and benefits systems between the merged organizations. PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH WPG (PwC), one of Germanyâ€™s leading auditing and consulting firms, frequently addresses this issue during post-merger integration, where different compensation structures must be harmonized. An objective and up-to-date overview of market compensation and benefits is essential to ensure fairness, maintain employee satisfaction, and support a smooth transition.

Job advertisements are a rich but unstructured source of data reflecting current market compensation and benefit trends across industries, regions, and company sizes. Extracting meaningful insights from this data requires automated, AI-supported methods capable of processing large volumes of textual information efficiently.

In collaboration with PwC, our project developed an AI-based market analysis tool that uses web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) to continuously collect, extract, and visualize compensation and benefits data from job advertisements. This tool provides PwC consultants with evidence-based insights to guide decision-making during post-merger integration.

Project Tasks
-------------

The project was structured into three main tasks, distributed among the team:

1. **Data Source Identification and Web Scraping:**  
   Identify accessible job advertisement sources and develop a reliable web scraping tool to enable continuous data extraction.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline:**  
   Design and implement an NLP pipeline to extract structured information from unstructured job advertisement texts, including qualifications, compensations, and benefits.

3. **Comprehensive Survey of Compensation and Benefits Trends and Dashboard Development:**  
   Conduct a literature review and empirical analysis of compensation and benefits trends to compare academic recommendations with market reality. Additionally, develop a dashboard to visualize and present the analyzed data effectively.

My Contribution: Compensation & Benefits Survey and Dashboard Creation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

My contribution involved two key elements. First, I performed a comprehensive review of compensation and benefits trends in human resources.

Second, I created a dashboard to visualize the compensation and benefits data extracted from job advertisements. The dashboard development followed these steps:

1. **Data Structure and Concept:**  
   Define relevant data elements, create a dummy data sets, and design a star schema to ensure clarity and enable efficient filtering.

2. **Mockup and Visualization:**
   Draft the dashboard layout including filters and interactive charts to guarantee a user-friendly experience.

3. **Implementation:**
   Develop the functional dashboard using Python and Dash by Plotly, translating the mockup into an interactive tool.

4. **Iterative Feedback Process:**
   Review the dashboard regularly with PwC and supervisors to refine filters, visualizations, and overall usability.

5. **Further Development:**
   Add automation through Docker and integrate live data source connections to enable continuous updates.

This dashboard provides a clear and accessible way for PwC consultants to explore compensation and benefits data, supporting informed decisions in post-merger integration projects.
