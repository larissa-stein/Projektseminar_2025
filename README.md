# AI-Supported Market Analysis of Compensation & Benefits in M&A Integrations

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered market analysis tool developed in collaboration with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to support compensation harmonization during post-merger integrations. The system combines web scraping, natural language processing, and interactive visualization to extract and present compensation trends from job advertisements.

## My Contribution: Compensation Analysis & Dashboard Development

I designed and implemented the complete data visualization platform with these academic and technical contributions:

### 1. Comprehensive Market Research
I conducted a systematic literature review of M&A compensation structures, developed a methodology to align academic recommendations with market realities, and created a comprehensive classification framework for benefits and compensations.

### 2. Dashboard Development Process
**Data Architecture:**
Designed a star schema for multidimensional analysis with automated data refreshes and validation pipelines.

**Visualization System:**
Built three interactive Dash views (trends, comparison, admin) with PwC-branded UI and synchronized filters.

**Technical Implementation:**
Deployed containerized solution using Docker with MongoDB/SQLite integration and HR data security measures.
