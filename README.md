# AI-Supported Market Analysis of Compensation & Benefits in M&A Integrations

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation to build an AI-powered dashboard that supports M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) to support benefit and compensation harmonization during post-merger integrations. The system combines web scraping, natural language processing, and interactive visualization to extract and present compensation trends from job advertisements.
